# Only working java Xbox API 

To use, download the zip and extract to your project (I used maven and intellij, use what you prefer) and import the json-simple.jar dependency to your project. Then, go to https://xboxapi.com and sign up and connect your xbox account. Copy the api key you receive to the String "API\_KEY" in the Root.Setup.GET.java and you are done! Put your gamertag in Root.xuid in the main class and experiment with all the different endpoints. I've organized a few (Like gamercard and profile) but the others like activity and messages and such just have WAY too much info. Organize it if you'd like and send it over and ill confirm it. :) It's all in JSON. If you have any questions, suggestions, or problems message me on instagram @java.lang.String
